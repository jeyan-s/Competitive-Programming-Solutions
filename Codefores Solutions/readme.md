# Codeforces Solutions

Welcome to my repository of Codeforces solutions! Here, you'll find my solutions to various Codeforces contests and problems. This repository serves as a record of my competitive programming journey and may be a resource for others seeking to learn or compare their solutions.

## Contest Structure

Each contest has its own directory, organized by the contest number. Inside each contest directory, you'll find solutions to individual problems named according to their problem code. For example:

- `A-Codeforces_Checking.py` (Solution for Problem A)
- `B-Following_Directions.py` (Solution for Problem B)
- `C-Prepend_and_Append.py` (Solution for Problem C)
- and so on...

## Notes

- This repository is a work in progress, and I will continue to add solutions to new contests and problems.
- Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, suggestions, or improvements regarding my solutions.

Happy coding!
